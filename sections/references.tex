\section{References}
    References are used like an alias to a variable. 

    With a variable \mylstbox{int var = 42;} a reference to it can be created with \mylstbox{int& myRef = var;}. 
    
    \mylstbox{myRef} can now be used exactly like \mylstbox{var}.
    
    References are never uninitialized and never have \mylstil{nullptr} as value.

    It is unspecified whether or not a reference requires storage.

\textbf{sizeof}: When using \mylstil{sizeof} on a reference, the size of the referenced object is returned.

\textbf{const}: By using \mylstil{const} on a reference, the referenced object cannot be changed.
