\section{Memory management}
    \textbf{Automatic memory management}: done by compiler, located on stack, LIFO (last in, first out) data structure, stack pointer points to top of stack, grows downwards.

    \textbf{Manual memory management}: done by programmer, located on heap, order of allocation and deallocation not defined, heap grows upwards. After \mylstil{delete}/\mylstil{free()} pointer needs to be set to 0 / \mylstil{nullptr}.
